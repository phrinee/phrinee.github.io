PhD Candidate in Computational Psychiatry @ KAIST GSMSE

I am a 2nd year Integrated MS-PhD program student majoring in Computational Psychiatry in the Graduate School of Medical Science and Engineering(GSMSE) at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology(KAIST) supervised by BumSeok Jeong.

In my research, I study differences in human behaviour and decision-making caused by psychiatric disorders. To do so, I use a variety of computational cognitive modelling techniques including Bayesian analysis, reinforcement learning, prospect theory and diffusion models.

Prior to my current journey, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Bio and Brain Engineering / Double major(School of Computing) from KAIST.
